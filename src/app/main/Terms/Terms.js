                    <p>

                        Caniny is cloud based software provided as available and as-is, which means that users don’t own
                        the content nor services intellectual property rights. Users can upload and edit their own
                        content, which give them ownership of any intellectual property rights that they hold in that
                        content. At any given time, users have the right to delete their content. On the other hand,
                        Caniny reserves the right to terminate the service without further notice, if Caniny senses that
                        the users are misusing or violating the provided service.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Caniny provides its own services to the users based on a reasonable level of care. Having stated
                        that, Caniny has its own reservation on what promises to commit to the users. Neither Caniny or
                        any of its partners aim to share any specific commitments or promises about the provided or
                        future services. That means that Caniny doesn’t aim to give any commitments about the provided
                        services, the content within the services, the features of the services nor their reliability,
                        availability or ability to meet the user’s expectations or needs. Even if that occurs, any
                        commitments or promises are subject for change without further notice. That means that the
                        services presented by Caniny are provided as available and as-is. Some jurisdictions provide for
                        certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for purpose and
                        non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, Caniny exclude all warranties.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When permitted by law, Caniny or any of its partners will not be responsible for any profits
                        lost, revenue lost, data misuse or lost, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential,
                        exemplary, or punitive damages. To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Caniny
                        and its partners, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is
                        limited to the amount that the user has paid to use the services, or if Caniny chooses to supply
                        the users the services again. In all cases, Caniny and its partners, will not be liable for any
                        loss or damage of any kind, and which is not reasonably foreseeable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Caniny has the right to modify or add these terms at any given time, which can be a necessity in
                        some cases to reflect any changes to the law or the provided services. Users are therefore
                        required to check and be updated on these terms on a regular basis. Caniny might be applying
                        changes to the terms, services or features without further notice. As an example, changes that
                        are required for legal reasons will be taking place immediately to ensure compliance. However,
                        if for any reason a conflict occurs between these terms and additional terms, the additional
                        terms will control for that conflict. Users who disagree with the modified terms or services are
                        encouraged to discontinue using the provided services. The presented terms control the
                        relationship between Caniny and the users. They do not create any third-party beneficiary
                        rights. If users do not comply with these terms, and Caniny doesn’t act right away, this doesn’t
                        mean that Caniny is giving up any rights that it may have, as an example act in the future. If
                        it turns out that a term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
